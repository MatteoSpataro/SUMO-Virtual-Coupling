# SUMO-Virtual-Coupling
The goal is to create a program that allows you to simulate multiple Virtual Coupling scenarios in the SUMO environment.

What is SUMO
------------

["Simulation of Urban MObility" (SUMO)](https://sumo.dlr.de/) is an open source, highly portable, microscopic traffic simulation package designed to handle large road networks and different modes of transport.

It is mainly developed by employees of the [Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de/ts).


Where to get it
---------------

You can download SUMO via our [downloads site](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.html).

As the program is still under development and is extended continuously, we advice you to use the latest sources from our GitHub repository. Using a command line client the following command should work:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/eclipse/sumo
